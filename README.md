Welcome to TV Tracker

this React App allows you to display a list of TV shows and their descriptions. The Current URLs for the poster images come from Wikipedia and any site that the user decides to add a URL from. Because this is dynamic, I cannot give credit ahead of time, but the ones that I have used are all from WIkipedia.

To set up SPA:

run $json-server --watch db.json --port=4000
run $npm start
